# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-09)

**Core value:** A recruiter from any of the analyst / brand / marketing / design worlds can self-select into the work that's relevant to their role in under a minute and walk away convinced Caleb can do that job.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — walking-skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-10

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- No data yet

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: **Astro** + content collections + build-time PDF rasterization (`pdfjs-dist` + `@napi-rs/canvas`), deployed to Cloudflare Pages, domain via Cloudflare Registrar — Framer-vs-Astro fork resolved in favor of Astro after confirming Caleb is comfortable with markdown + git
- Visual direction: **Magazine maximalist** locked from sketch 001 — Bricolage Grotesque + Fraunces italic + JetBrains Mono, warm cream + ink + 4 saturated accents, rotated cards with layered decorative geometry
- Project mode: **mvp** — Phase 1 is a walking skeleton; each subsequent phase thickens a continuously-deployable slice

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Domain availability** — `caleblim.com` is the target but availability not yet verified at Cloudflare Registrar. Fallbacks: `caleblim.co`, `caleb.work`, middle-name variant. Resolved during Phase 6, not blocking earlier phases.
- **Personal Projects content** — undefined for v1 per PROJECT.md. If genuinely zero pieces at Phase 2 content-load time, drop the card from splash rather than ship an empty room (codified in SPLASH-04).
- **PDF rasterization POC** — Phase 1 includes a 30-min proof-of-concept against one of Caleb's real PDFs before Phase 2 productionizes the pipeline. Mixed landscape/portrait + varying PDF versions could surface edge cases.
